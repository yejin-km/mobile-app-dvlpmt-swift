                Hey there - My name is Leo!
                Likes: to be pet and held!
                Dislikes: thunderstorms
                Wants: to be your bestest furry friend in the whole wide world!
                Needs: you to help guide me as I learn how to navigate life
                How did I get here? Transferred from Tiny Tigers Rescue; adopted and returned due to not being the right fit.
                
                âœ¶ I have tested positive for FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus), but the good news is I can still live a long normal cat life! I am also blind, but this does not slow me down in the slightest! Talk to an adoption specialist for more details about how to care for me! I am currently living in a foster home - please fill out a survey and select a phone appointment to complete the adoption process. Once that process is complete, your adoption specialist will schedule a time for you to meet me in person!
