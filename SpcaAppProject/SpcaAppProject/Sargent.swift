                Awoooo! I'm Sargent.
                Likes: When you tell me how handsome I am
                Dislikes: Going the whole day without a nap
                Wants: For you to shower me with attention
                Needs: To sit in your lap - I swear I can fit if I try hard enough!
                I am full grown at ~ 57 lbs.
                How did I get here? Transferred from Warren County Animal Ark where I came in as a stray.
                
                âœ¶ I have recently completed treatment for heartworm disease- please speak with an adoption specialist for details.
