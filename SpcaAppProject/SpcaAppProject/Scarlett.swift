                Hi, I'm Scarlett!
                I like giving lots and lots of kisses.
                I dislike days where we skip going for a walk - leash walks are the best!
                I want to eat - food, treats, peanut butter. I love it all!
                I need to find my forever home.
                I am fully grown at ~48 lbs.
                How did I get here? Transferred from Warren County Animal Ark where I was brought in as a stray.
                
                âœ¶ I have been diagnosed with heartworm disease and will begin treatment soon - please speak with an adoption specialist for details. I am currently living at the admission center - please fill out a survey and select a phone appointment to complete the adoption process. Once that process is complete, your adoption specialist will schedule a time for you to meet me in person!
