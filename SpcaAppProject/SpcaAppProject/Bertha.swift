                Hello, they call me Bertha!
                I love: playing fetch, carrying my bone around and offering it to everyone I meet
                I hate: the hustle and bustle of city life
                I want: belly rubs and bones to chew
                I need: to go home with you!
                I am full grown at ~75 lbs.
                How did I get here? Transferred from Harnett
                County Shelter after coming to them as a stray.
                    
                âœ¶ I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and am currently
                maintaining well on medication- please speak with
                an adoption specialist for details.
